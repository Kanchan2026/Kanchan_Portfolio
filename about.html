      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I am a second-year student at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, 
        studying Business Information Technology with a focus on Game Development. 
        I am a motivated UI/UX and Unity UI Designer with a strong interest in designing user interfaces 
        for games and mobile applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy creating clean, intuitive, and visually appealing user interfaces and implementing them directly in Unity. 
        I have hands-on experience with tools such as Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, 
        and Unity UI systems, where I design and implement menus, HUDs, buttons, and responsive layouts for game projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy collaborating with developers and artists and refining my designs based on feedback. 
        Currently, I am focused on improving my skills in mobile game UI, UI animations, and user-centered design, 
        and I am eager to grow as a UI Artist and UI Designer through real-world projects and practical training opportunities.
      </p>
